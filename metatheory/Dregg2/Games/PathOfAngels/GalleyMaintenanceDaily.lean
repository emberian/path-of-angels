# GalleyMaintenanceDaily — one replayable commons maintenance loop

This is deliberately an integration, not a third event kernel.  A daily begins
with the existing `HolderMechanics` ballot surface: public one-player/one-voice,
holder choir votes with the already-proved cap, and zero-world-output holder
sponsorship.  Only a two-chamber pass opens a short ordered maintenance procedure.
Sentyr authors every task, instruction, action, success, and failure content id.

The same stream also carries the galley's shared daily commons.  A bounded set
of authored rotations selects an exact scene and menu by day.  Each player may
visit once; scarce featured servings have capacities, but filling one never
turns later players away—they receive an authored neighborly alternative.  The
small local-service amount is type-capped and is deliberately outside voting,
procedure progress, finalized output, and canon authority.  DREGG sponsorships
are retained as acknowledgements while a parametric theorem proves that their
accepted transition leaves both ballot chambers unchanged.

The procedure has one terminal output.  It is not a self-declared contribution:
the secure surface requires an opaque durable-output admission over the exact
activated full specification and finalized coordinate, then re-runs the native
judge and exact mission/contribution/federation checks.  Exact coordinates and
receipt hashes are first consumed by a separate deployment-global registry CAS;
the output action has no authority constructor without that committed proof.

The raw reducer and event adapter are private.  Production commands retain the
exact activation, prestate, cursor/head, actor, sequence and consume-once
nullifier.  The only public continuation surface starts from an opaque persisted
runtime, uses its deployment-fixed digest boundary, and returns an opaque
candidate that becomes a predecessor only after exact whole-snapshot CAS.
