# Path of Angels — sealed-salvage Bazaar workbook

One executable player journey, parameterized only by the two deployment
capabilities this module intentionally cannot fabricate:

* solve a real Signal mission whose checked contribution yields relic 9001;
* acquire the exact judged run in the Field Archive;
* list its already-crowned, indivisible note;
* fork one exact opened round into a cancellation branch and a sale branch;
* accept four opaque envelopes on the sale branch and close the book;
* run the existing opening-aware V1 Dark Bazaar authorization;
* consume its exact settlement and transfer custody to the taker.

The hostile workbook also exercises canonical-head forks, registry replay,
malformed custody, duplicate/capacity/cancellation timing, non-zero fee
refusals, house-blind refusal, expiry, wrong-batch settlement, replay,
double-listing, and the observation-only crown blocker.  The gameplay data is
closed; authority and crown certification remain explicit abstract inputs.
Facts which transit the existing native V1 fixture are named and accounted with
`#assert_compiled`; generic Bazaar laws remain kernel-pinned in `BazaarGame`.
