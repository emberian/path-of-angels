# ShipLifeProgression — a receipt-only projection of life aboard the Khovokhi

This is deliberately not a second game authority.  Expedition outcomes,
attendant transitions, crafting, gallery registration, ordinary-part exchange,
crew health, holder eligibility, and finalized daily claims are accepted only as
typed receipts from their named authorities.  This coordinator owns no balance,
inventory, custody, companion, health, or canon successor.  It owns only replayed
receipt indexes and disposable beta-facing views: career pages, cadence, loadout
previews, collections, recovery displays, cosmetic flair, and suggested unlocks.

That separation is the platform architecture.  Many small games may enrich one
ship-life page without acquiring the ability to mint a resource, kill an
attendant, move a relic, promote canon, or turn a holder badge into power.

The present direct authorities are `Shipworks.Settlement`,
`CrewFieldMissionRuntime`, and `AttendantContinuityAggregate`.  Expedition intake
is the opaque runtime + EventBatch receipt exposed by `ShipExpeditionSeason`; it
never proves acceptance by inspecting a season projection.  Craft/gear,
GalleryGated, crew-health, and ordinary-parts
Bazaar adapters are intentionally sealed seams until those authorities expose
canonical receipt codecs.  In particular, current `BazaarGame` relic salvage is
not silently reclassified as an ordinary market part.
