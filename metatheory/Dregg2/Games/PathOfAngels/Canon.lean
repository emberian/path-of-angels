# Dregg2.Games.PathOfAngels.Canon — beta records and curator-only alpha canon.

A game can add an exact artifact to the beta record.  It cannot move anything into
alpha canon or supersede an alpha artifact.  Those transitions require the opaque
`CuratorCapability`, an expected revision, and the exact four-part `ArtifactRef`.
There is deliberately no constructor for that capability in the game semantics.
