# AttendantContinuityAggregate — owner-wide, replay-first companion continuity

An attendant should remain the same cared-for thing across sessions, crashes,
projection rebuilds, and later mechanic revisions.  This module joins the
proof-carrying `AttendantKernel` transition receipt to the generic
`EventSourcing` kernel without moving any attendant semantics into a database
adapter.

The aggregate is deliberately owner-wide for one activated template.  The
kernel spends activity credits in an owner-global `OwnerLedger`; independent
per-attendant streams could otherwise race that ledger and accept the same
credit once for each attendant.  One dense stream therefore carries:

* every owned attendant's exact current kernel projection;
* the one exact owner ledger shared by those attendants;
* care, repair, equipment, and capability history indexes;
* exact canon-settled activity-credit keys and receipt identifiers;
* dense replay and snapshot/cache recovery.

This is pre-Aspect continuity only.  It assigns no personality, lore, copying,
custody-market, or future Aspect semantics.
