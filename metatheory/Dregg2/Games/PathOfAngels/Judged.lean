# Dregg2.Games.PathOfAngels.Judged — executable runtime admission

`JudgedRun` is abstract outside this module.  It is produced only by
`judgeActive`, which checks an exact active game/config projection, all content
and activation domains, the authenticated carrying-turn context, and the current
canonical player counter before invoking one concrete game judge.

The semantic judge remains publicly replayable.  Network authority is not source
secrecy and is not an unconstructible token: the adapter must derive
`FinalizedCarrier` from the already-finalized Dregg turn/receipt, then this module
checks every value it consumes.  A caller can model those inputs, but cannot forge
a `JudgedRun` constructor or bypass the executable equality retained below.
